## Additional Notes

### Custom Data

Users can modify the tool to use their own individual data by ensuring it is in the correct format.

### Future Steps

Given more time, the following steps could have been explored:

1. **User Authentication:** Implement user accounts to securely store and retrieve personal health data.
2. **Data Import/Export:** Allow users to import/export their biosensor data in various formats.
3. **Additional Metrics:** Expand the tool to include more health metrics and customizable dashboard components.
4. **Responsive Design:** Optimize the interface for a seamless experience across different devices.
